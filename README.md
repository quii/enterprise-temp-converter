# enterprise temperature converter experiment

## Things to explore

- Structuring code in such a way that we can _easily_ re-use specifications
- Have two different applications that fullfill the specifications
  - Drivers to connect the implementation and spec
- Simple re-use of "domain logic" between the two implementations
